## Introduction

The Rust programming language uses deterministic versioning for toolchain releases. Stable versions use SemVer, 
while nightly, beta and historical builds can be accessed by using dated builds (YY-MM-DD).

Unfortunately, a clean index of releases is not available any more. I decided to research which resources where still available
and found the following solutions:
    
  1) Use the AWS index <sup>(<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/56971#issuecomment-527199391">source</a>)</sup>
  2) Build from individual [release manifests](https://static.rust-lang.org/manifests.txt) <sup>(<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/56971#issuecomment-527199391">source</a>)</sup>
  3) Parse Rust in-repo [RELEASES.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rust-lang/rust/master/RELEASES.md)

Each of these options requires additional parsing, which is where this crate comes in: the `rust-releases` crate
can obtain, parse and build an index from the above resources. This crate also provides methods to iterate over versions 
in a _linear_ fashion, or by using a _bisect_ binary search strategy.

Each data source implements the [Source](https://docs.rs/rust-releases/latest/rust_releases/source/trait.Source.html) trait.  `Source` provides a `build_index` method, which can be used to
build a catalog of released Rust versions. In addition, for all solution except `DistIndex`, it is possible to let this crate
[fetch](https://docs.rs/rust-releases/latest/rust_releases/source/trait.FetchResources.html) the required input documents.

<sup>1</sup>: Currently most of the `rust-releases` public API supports only stable. Support for the beta and nightly channel is work-in-progress, and the table currently lists whether there is theoretical support for these channels.<br> 
<sup>2</sup>: Speed for the `Source` trait primarily consist of parsing speed<br> 
<sup>3</sup>: Speed for the `FetchResources` trait is primarily limited by your own download speed, and the rate limiting of the server from which the resources are fetched<br>
<sup>4</sup>: Approximate as of 2020-03-03 <br>

**Which data source should I use?**

Since support for the beta and nightly channels is work-in-progress, I would advise to use the `RustChangelog` data source as it's
a small download, immediately up-to-date on release and fast to parse. It only supports stable channel releases.

Alternatively, the `RustDist` or `DistIndex` data sources can be useful, especially when support for the beta and nightly channel are added.
They both get their input data from the Rust AWS S3 distribution bucket. When using `RustDist`, the input data can be obtained
with the `FetchResources` trait implementation. For `DistIndex`, you have to obtain the input data yourself (by running the
`aws` cli with the following options `aws --no-sign-request s3 ls static-rust-lang-org/dist/ > dist.txt`<sup>(<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/56971#issuecomment-527199391">source</a>)</sup>).

The `ChannelManifests` source has the most potential, as the input data is the most complete. 
We can most easily extend information about releases beyond the version for this source. Once downloaded, it's quite fast since each release manifest is cached as a separate file. 
However, the initial download is quite large and frankly, because of rate limiting, also quite slow. In addition,
the resource is approximately one-week out of date since the root manifest is only updated one week after a release <sup>(<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/56971#issuecomment-527199391">source</a>)</sup>.
_NB: The input data has not been updated since 2020-02-23_<sup>(<a href="https://github.com/foresterre/rust-releases/issues/9">#9</a>)</sup>.

## Applications

[cargo-msrv](https://github.com/foresterre/cargo-msrv) is a tool which can be used to determine the minimal supported Rust version (MSRV).
In cargo-msrv I started by parsing the latest channel manifest, and then decreasing the minor semver version.

This is not great for many reasons:
* Except for the latest released version, we are left guessing the decreased version numbers
  actually exist
* Only stable versions are supported, not nightly, beta, or other channels
* Only 1.x.0 versions are supported

This is not ideal, thus `rust-releases` was born. Now cargo-msrv can iterate over Rust releases of which we know they exist and are available.
